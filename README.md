# Working with REST API (GET).

1. Implement the “Working with a GET request” block according to the mockup and API
   documentation. Display 6 users on the API request result page. The "Show more" button
   should be hidden when the last page of API query results is reached. Users are sorted by
   registration date (the newest first).
2. To display radio buttons on the registration form, use the GET /positions method from the API
   documentation.
